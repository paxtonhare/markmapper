== Contributing & Development

    $ git clone https://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper && cd mongomapper
    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rake

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix. All specs should pass.
* Add specs for your changes. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself in another branch so a maintainer ignore it when your pull request is merged.
* Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
