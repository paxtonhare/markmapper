The two document types are "Document":/documentation/document.html and "EmbeddedDocument":/documentation/embedded-document.html. They are made up of "Plugins":/documentation/plugins/. Also built-in is a simple "type":/documentation/types.html system that supports all of MarkLogic's types out of the box and allows you to add your own.
