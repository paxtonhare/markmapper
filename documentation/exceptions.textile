All MarkMapper exceptions inherit from MarkMapper::Error, which inherits from Ruby's StandardError.

* *MarkMapper::DocumentNotFound*: Raised when document expected to exist, but not found in database (ie: find!).
* *MarkMapper::InvalidScheme*: Raised when connecting using URI with incorrect scheme.
* *MarkMapper::NotSupported*: Raised when trying to do something not supported, mostly with embedded documents.
* *MarkMapper::DocumentNotValid*: Raised when creating, updating or saving with ! and a document is not valid.
* *MarkMapper::AccessibleOrProtected*: Raised when attr_accessible and attr_protected are both called on the same model.
