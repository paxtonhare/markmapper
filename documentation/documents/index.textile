MarkMapper documents are the equivalent of models in ActiveRecord. An instantiated "MarkMapper::Document":{{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/documents/document.html class represents a single document in a MarkLogic collection. It also provides a number of class methods used for "querying the collection":{{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/plugins/querying.html itself. You can embed documents inside other documents (rather than in their own collections) using the "MarkMapper::EmbeddedDocument":{{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/documents/embedded-document.html class.
