Declare @userstamps!@ in your model to add @creator@ and @updater@ methods to your document. The values must be set manually like so:

{% highlight ruby %}
class User
  include MarkMapper::Document

  key :name, String
end

class Post
  include MarkMapper::Document

  key :body, String
  userstamps!
end

u = User.create(:name => 'John')
u2 = User.create(:name => 'J-P')
p = Post.new(:body => 'Lorem ipsum etc..')
p.creator = u
p.updater = u2
p.save
{% endhighlight %}

Note that your users must be in a model with a class named @User@ for this to work.

In the above example, @p.creator@ would result in the same user as @u@ and @p.updater@ would result in the same user as @u2@.
