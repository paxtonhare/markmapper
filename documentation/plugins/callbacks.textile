title: Callbacks

MarkMapper makes use of the "ActiveModel::Callbacks":http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Callbacks.html, so they are identical to Rails.

The callbacks supported are the same as on ActiveModel, the callbacks provided are:

 * before_validation
 * after_validation
 * before_save
 * after_save
 * before_create
 * after_create
 * before_update
 * after_update
 * before_destroy
 * after_destroy

For embedded documents you have similar callbacks:

 * before_validation
 * after_validation
 * before_save
 * after_save
 * before_create
 * after_create
 * before_update
 * after_update
 * before_destroy
 * after_destroy

h2. Example

The callbacks are set on your model like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Monkey
  include MarkMapper::Document
  before_save :do_something_before_save

  private
  def do_something_before_save
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
