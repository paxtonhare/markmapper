title: Single Collection Inheritance
---

Single Collection Inheritance ("SCI") allows you to store multiple types of similar documents into a single collection. The most common case is when you have a hierarchy of objects that inherit behavior and attributes.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Field
  include MarkMapper::Document
  key :name, :required => true
end

class FileUpload < Field
  plugin Joint
  attachment :file
  validates_length_of :file_size, :minimum => 0, :maximum => 10.megabytes
end

class TextField < Field
end

class RadioButton < Field
  many :options
end
{% endhighlight %}

When you inherit from a model, MarkMapper adds at @_type@ attribute to your model, which is set when your model is created.
