Documents are first class citizens in MarkMapper. Out of the box you can persist them to collections and they can be related to other documents or embedded documents. They also come with all the typical dressings, such as "associations":/documentation/plugins/associations.html, "callbacks":/documentation/plugins/callbacks.html, "serialization":/documentation/plugins/serialization.html, "validations":/documentation/plugins/validations.html, and rich "querying":/documentation/plugins/querying.html.

class Article

  key :title,        String
  key :content,      String
  key :published_at, Time

h2(#custom-connections). Custom Connections

You override the MarkLogic connection or collection name for a model:

{% highlight ruby %}
class MyModel
  include MarkMapper::Document

  connection MarkLogic::MarkLogicClient.new('localhost', 27017)
  set_database_name "my_database"
end
{% endhighlight %}
